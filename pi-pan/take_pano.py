#================================================
# this program takes panorama pictures in a grid
# and puts them in /var/tmp folder.
# You can then use autostitch or similar program
# to build a panorama.

# at the beginning it centers the camera and waits
# for you to align the camera.
# it will move the camera up/down in small increments to
# indicate it has finished.
# A log file is also created about images of this panorama:
# /var/tmp/pano_log_...txt

# to run this script when pi boots up:
# insert this script in /etc/init.d/servoblaster.sh
# (in do_start function) as follows:
#  do_start () {
#	   /usr/local/sbin/servod --idle-timeout=2000 --p1pins=16,18 >/dev/null
#      sleep 2
#      python ~pi/pi-pan/take_pano.py
#  }
